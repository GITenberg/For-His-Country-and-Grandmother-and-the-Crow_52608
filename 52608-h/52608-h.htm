<hr class="hrsm" />

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;My country! &#39;tis of thee,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Sweet land of liberty,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Of thee I sing!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>


<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Here</span> the singer&#39;s voice broke down, and I
peered curiously around my corner of the wall.
He was pacing to and fro on the river-bank&mdash;a
weary-faced lad with pale cheeks and drooping
shoulders. Beyond him a fat French footman
lay asleep on the grass, one hand loosely
clutching a novel. An elderly goat, grazing
nearer and nearer the man, kept a wary eye on
the book, and finally seizing it, devoured it leaf
by leaf. At this the weary-faced boy did not
smile, and then I knew there was something
the matter with him.</p>

<p class="indent">Partly because I wished to console him,
partly because I was lonely, I continued the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
song in notes rather more cheerful than his
own:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;Land where my fathers died,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Land of the pilgrims&#39; pride,</span><br />
<span class="i2">From every mountainside</span><br />
<span class="i4">Let freedom ring!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The boy stood stock-still, only moving his
head slightly after the manner of a bird listening
to a pleasant strain. When I finished he
came toward me, cap in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mademoiselle, you are an American?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my boy. I am a Canadian.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s next best,&quot; he said, politely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s better,&quot; I rejoined, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is better than being an American.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are patriotic,&quot; I observed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If your ancestors fought with Indians, and
English and rebels, and if you expect to die for
your country, you ought to be patriotic.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I surveyed him curiously. He was too grave
and joyless for a boy in a normal condition.
&quot;In youth one does not usually speak of dying,&quot;
I said.</p>

<p class="indent">His face flushed. &quot;Ah, mademoiselle, I am
homesick! I have not seen America for a
year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;Indeed? Such a patriotic boy should stay
at home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My mother wished me to finish my education
abroad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A woman should educate her children in
the country in which they are to live,&quot; I said,
irritably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess you&#39;re most old enough to be my
mother, aren&#39;t you?&quot; he replied, gently, and
with such tenderness of rebuke that I smiled
irrepressibly. He had delicately intimated that
if I were his mother I would not care to have
him discuss me with a stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got to learn foreign languages,&quot; he
said, doggedly. &quot;We&#39;ve been here one year;
we must stay one more and then go to Italy,
then to Germany. I&#39;m thankful the English
haven&#39;t a different language. If they had, I&#39;d
have to go learn it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And after you leave Germany?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After Germany&mdash;home!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was not a particularly handsome lad, but
he had beautiful eyes, and at the word home
they took on such a strange brilliance that I
gathered up my parasol and books in wondering
silence.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
&quot;I suppose,&quot; he said, soberly, &quot;that you will
not be at the Protestant church on Sunday?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Probably I shall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see many people from America,&quot; he
went on, turning his head so far away that I
could hardly hear what he said. &quot;There isn&#39;t
anybody here who cares to talk about it. My
mother, of course, is too busy,&quot; he added, with
dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Au revoir</i>, then,&quot; I said, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood looking quietly after me, and when
I got far up the river-bank I turned around.
He was adjusting a slight difference between
the footman and the goat; then, followed by
the man, he disappeared up one of the quaint
old streets leading into the heart of the city.</p>

<p class="indent">Close beside me a little old peasant woman,
gathering sticks, uncurled her stooping figure.
&quot;<i>Bon jour, mademoiselle!</i> You have been talking
to the American boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Oui, madame.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very sad,&quot; she continued, in the excellent
French spoken by the peasants of the
Loiret department. &quot;He comes by the river
and declaims. He speaks of Linkum and
Wash&#39;ton. I watch from my cottage, for my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
daughter Mathilde is housemaid at Madame
Greyshield&#39;s, and I hear her talk. <i>Monsieur
le colonel</i> Greyshield is a grand officer in
America; but his wife, she is proud. She
brings her children to France to study.
She leaves the poor man lonely. This boy is
most heartbroke. Mathilde says he talks of his
dear country in his sleep, then he rises early
to study the foreign languages, so he can more
quickly go to his home. But he is sick, his
hand trembles. Mathilde thinks he is going to
die. I say, &#39;Mathilde, talk to madame,&#39; but
she is afraid, for madame has a will as strong
as this stout stick. It will never break. It
must be burnt. Perhaps mademoiselle will
talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will, if I get a chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old woman turned her brown, leathery
face toward the blue waters of the Loire.
&quot;Mademoiselle, do many French go to America
for the accent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; they have too much sense!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is droll,&quot; she went on, &quot;how the families
come here. The gentlemen wander to and fro,
the ladies occupy themselves with their <i>toilettes</i>.
Then they travel to other countries. They are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
like the leaves on that current. They wander
they know not whither. I am only a peasant,
yet I can think, and is not one language good
enough to ask for bread and soup?&quot; And
muttering and shaking her head, she went on
gathering her sticks.</p>

<div class="image-center">
<a name="i_018" id="i_018"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_018.jpg" width="600" height="537" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">On Sunday I looked for my American boy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
There he was, sitting beside a handsomely
dressed woman, who looked as if she might indeed
have a will like a stout stick. After the
service he endeavoured to draw her toward me,
but she did not respond until she saw me
speaking to a lady of Huguenot descent, to
whom I had had a letter of introduction. Then
she approached, and we all went down the
street together.</p>

<p class="indent">When we reached the boulevard leading to
my hotel, the boy asked his mother&#39;s permission
to escort me home. She hesitated, and
then said, &quot;Yes; but do not bore her to death
with your patriotic rigmaroles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy, whose name was Gerald, gave her a
peculiar glance, and did not open his lips until
we had walked a block. Then he asked, deliberately,
&quot;Have you ever thought much of
that idea of Abraham Lincoln&#39;s that no man is
good enough to govern another man without
the other man&#39;s consent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, a good deal; yet one must obey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, one must obey,&quot; he said, quietly.
&quot;But sometimes it is puzzling, especially when
a fellow is growing up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
&quot;Fourteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not older?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; I am from California,&quot; and he drew
himself up. &quot;The boys and girls there are
large, you know. I have lost twenty pounds
since we came here. You have never been in
California, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 508px;">
<a name="i_021" id="i_021"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_021.jpg" width="508" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;I AM FROM CALIFORNIA.&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I like California.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do?&quot; He flashed one swift glance at
me, then dropped his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">I politely averted my own, but not before I
saw two tear-drops splash on the hot, gray
pavement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I could see,&quot; he said, presently, &quot;if I
could see one of those brown hills, just one,&mdash;this
flat country makes me tired.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you imagine,&quot; I said, &quot;that I have
been as homesick in California as you are in
France?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! no!&quot; he replied, breathlessly. &quot;No,
I could not imagine that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That I sailed into San Francisco Bay with
a heartache because those brown hills you speak
of so lovingly were not my native hills?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are grown up; you do not need to
leave your country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
&quot;Our duty sometimes takes us to foreign
lands. You will be a better soldier some day
for having had a time of trial and endurance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it,&quot; he said, under his breath. &quot;But
sometimes I think I must break loose, especially
at night, when the bugles blow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I knew what he meant. At eight o&#39;clock
every evening, from the various barracks in
Orléans, the sweet, piercing notes of bugle
answering bugle could be heard; and the strain
was the one played by the American bugles in
the school that I guessed he had attended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think of the boys drawn up in line on
the drill-ground, and the echo behind the hill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know Almoda?&quot; he exclaimed, with
a face as white as a sheet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was too much for him. We had paused
at the hotel entrance, and he intended, I knew,
to take a polite leave of me; but I had done a
dangerous thing in conjuring up the old familiar
scenes, and mumbling something in his throat,
and giving one tug to his hat, he ran as nimbly
down the street as if he were a lean coyote
from the hills of his native State.</p>

<p class="indent">Four weeks later I asked myself why I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
lingering in Orléans. I had seen all the souvenirs
of Joan of Arc; I had talked with the
peasants and shopkeepers till I was tired; I
agreed thoroughly with my guide-book that Orléans
is a city sadly lacking in animation; and
yet I stayed on; I stayed on because I was
engaged in a bit of character study, I told my
note-book; stayed on because my presence afforded
some consolation to a struggling, unhappy
boy, I told my conscience.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy was dying of homesickness. He
did not enter into the life of the sleepy French
city. &quot;This is a good enough country,&quot; he
said, wearily, &quot;but it isn&#39;t mine. I want
America, and it seems to me all these priests
and soldiers and citizens are acting. I can&#39;t
think they were born speaking French.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, it was only at rare intervals that
he complained. Away in America he had a
father who had set the high standard of duty
before him,&mdash;a father who would not encourage
him to flag.</p>

<p class="indent">On the Fourth of July, Mrs. Greyshield was
giving a reception&mdash;not on account of the day,
for she had not a spark of patriotism, but because
she was shortly to leave Orléans for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
seashore. Gerald was also giving a reception,
his a smaller one, prepared for in the face of
almost insurmountable difficulties, for he received
no encouragement from his mother in
his patriotic schemes.</p>

<p class="indent">His only pleasure in life was in endeavouring
to make his little brother and sister as patriotic
as himself, and with ill-concealed dismay he
confided to me the fear that they were forgetting
their native land.</p>

<p class="indent">About the middle of the afternoon I joined
him and the children in a small, gaily decorated
arbour at the foot of the garden. Shortly after
I arrived, Mrs. Greyshield, accompanied by a
number of her guests, swept down upon us.
The French officers and their wives and a
number of English residents surrounded the
arbour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, the delicious cakes! But they are
not <i>babas</i> and <i>savarins</i> and <i>tartelettes</i>! They
must be American! What do you call this
kind? Doughnuts! How peculiar! How effective
the arrangement of the bunting, and
how many flags&mdash;but all of his own country!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greyshield listened carelessly to the comments.
&quot;Oh, yes, he is hopelessly provincial.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
I shall never teach him to be cosmopolitan.
What do you think of such narrowness, princess?&quot;
and in veiled admiration she addressed
her most distinguished guest, who was also
her friend and countrywoman.</p>

<p class="indent">As Mrs. Greyshield spoke, the American
princess, who was the possessor of an exceedingly
bitter smile, touched one of the flags with
caressing fingers. &quot;It is a long time since I
have seen one. Your boy has several. I should
like to have one for a cushion, if he will permit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy&#39;s nostrils dilated. &quot;For a cushion!&quot;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">His tone was almost disrespectful, and his
mother gave him a warning glance, and said,
hastily, &quot;Certainly, princess. Gerald, choose
your prettiest flag.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for a cushion!&quot; he said, firmly. &quot;The
flag should be up, never down!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gay group gazed with concealed interest
at mother and son.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greyshield seized a flag and offered it
to her guest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you&mdash;not from you,&quot; said the princess,
putting up her lorgnette. &quot;Only from
the boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
He would not give her one. His mother
was in a repressed rage, and the boy kept his
eyes bent on the ground in suffering silence.</p>

<p class="indent">The titled lady put an end to the painful
scene. &quot;I have changed my mind,&quot; she
said, coolly. &quot;I have too many cushions
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy turned swiftly to her, and, lifting the
white hand hanging by her side, gently touched
it with his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Madame la Princesse</i>, you, too, love your
country!&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 543px;">
<a name="i_027" id="i_027"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_027.jpg" width="543" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;&#39;YOU, TOO, LOVE YOUR COUNTRY!&#39;&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">His exclamation was so enthusiastic, so
heartfelt, there was in it such a world of commiseration
for the titled lady before him, that
there immediately flashed before each one
present the unhappy life of the poor princess
in exile. The boy had started a wave of
sympathy flowing from one to another of the
group, and in some confusion they all moved
away.</p>

<p class="indent">Gerald wiped the perspiration from his forehead,
and went on with the programme of patriotic
selections that the impatient children
were obliged to go through before they could
have the cakes and fireworks.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
After the fizzing and bursting noises were
over, I said, regretfully, &quot;Gerald, I must go to
Paris to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been expecting this,&quot; he said, with
dogged resignation. &quot;When you are gone,
Miss Canada, I shall have no one to talk to me
about America.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I had grown to love the boy for his high
qualities of mind and soul, and my voice faltered
as I murmured, &quot;Do not give up,&mdash;fight the
good fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of faith,&quot; he added, gravely, &quot;looking forward
to what is to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It seemed to me that an old man stood pressing
my hand&mdash;an old man with life&#39;s experience
behind him. My heart ached for the lad, and I
hurried into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; I said, coldly, to my hostess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, a pleasant journey,&quot; she responded,
with equal coldness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do not take that boy of yours home,
you will lose him,&quot; I murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">I thought my voice was low, but it was not
low enough to escape the ears of the princess,
who was standing beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Greyshield turned away, and the princess&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
lips moved almost imperceptibly in the
words, &quot;What is the use?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The boy is dying by inches!&quot; I said, indignantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better dead than like those&mdash;&quot; she said,
with her bitter smile, nodding toward the chattering
cosmopolitan crowd beyond us.</p>

<p class="indent">I echoed the boy&#39;s words: &quot;You, too, are a
patriot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was,&quot; she said, gravely, and sauntered away.</p>

<p class="indent">I went unhappily to Paris. Would that
another stranger could chance along, to whom
the boy might unburden his heart,&mdash;his noble
heart, filled not only with dreams of military
glory, but of plans for the protection of the
weak and helpless among his countrymen!</p>

<p class="indent">A week later a telegram from the princess
summoned me to Orléans. To my surprise,
she met me on the staircase of Mrs. Greyshield&#39;s
house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Mrs.
Greyshield is to lose her boy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">My first feeling was one of anger. &quot;Do not
speak of such a thing!&quot; I said, harshly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come and see,&quot; and she led the way to a
room where the weary-faced lad lay on a huge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
canopied bed, a nursing sister on either side of
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The doctors are in consultation below,&quot; she
murmured; &quot;but there is no hope.&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center">
<a name="i_032" id="i_032"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_032.jpg" width="600" height="587" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is his mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In her room. She sees no one. It is a
foreign fashion, you know. She is suffering
deeply&mdash;at last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
&quot;Oh, this is horrible!&quot; I said. &quot;Can nothing
be done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you observe what a perfect accent he
has?&quot; she said, meditatively. &quot;There must
be excellent teachers at the <i>lycée</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the bed came occasionally muttered
scraps of French prose or poetry, and I shuddered
as I listened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sacrificed for an accent!&quot; she went on to
herself. &quot;It is a favourite amusement of American
mothers. This boy was torn from a father
whom he worshipped. I wonder what he will
say when his wife returns to America with two
living children and one&mdash;&quot; She turned to me.
&quot;I could have told her that growing children
should not be hurried from one country to
another. Yet it is better this way than the
other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The other?&quot; I repeated, stupidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the other,&mdash;after years of residence
abroad, no home, no country, no attachments, a
weary traveller till one dies. I thought you
might like to see him, as you were so attracted
by him. He fainted the day you left, and has
been this way ever since. It cannot last much
longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
We had been speaking in a low tone, yet our
voices must have been heard by the sleeper, for
suddenly he turned his head on the pillow and
looked at us.</p>

<p class="indent">The princess approached him, and murmured
his name in an exquisitely soft and gentle voice.
The boy recognised her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, the princess!&quot; he said, collectedly.
&quot;May I trouble you with a message?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is for papa,&quot; he said, dreamily. &quot;Will
you tell him for me, please&mdash;&quot; Here his
voice died away, and his dark, beseeching eyes
rolled from one to another of the people in
the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I send them away?&quot; asked the princess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, thank you. It is only the pain. Will
you&mdash;will you be good enough to tell papa not
to think me a coward? I promised him to hold
out, but&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will tell him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And tell him I&#39;m sorry we couldn&#39;t build
that home and live together, but I think if
he prepared it mamma and the children might
go. Tell him I think they would be happier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
America is so lovely! Mamma would get used
to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped, panting for breath, and one of
the nurses put something on his lips, while the
other wiped away the drops of moisture that
the effort of speaking had brought to his
spectral face. Then he closed his eyes, and
his pallid figure seemed to be sinking away
from us; but presently he roused himself, and
this time his glance fell on me.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Canada,&quot; he said, drowsily, &quot;the salute
to the flag&mdash;Dottie and Howard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The princess motioned to one of the nurses,
who slipped from the room and presently returned
with the children. A wan, evanescent
flush overspread his face at sight of the flag,
and he tried to raise himself on his elbow. One
of the nurses supported him, and he fixed his
glazing but still beautiful eyes on the children.
&quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The small boy and girl were far from realising
their brother&#39;s condition, but they knew what
he wished, and in a warbling voice little Dottie
began:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;This is my country&#39;s flag, and I am my country&#39;s child,</span><br />
<span class="i2">To love and serve her well will ever be my joy.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
A little farther on her tiny brother took up
the formula which it had been Gerald&#39;s pleasure
to teach them.</p>

<div class="image-center">
<a name="i_036" id="i_036"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/i_036.jpg" width="567" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The consultation below had broken up, and
several of the doctors had crept to the door of
the room, but the boy did not seem to notice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
them. His attention was riveted on the children,
to the exclusion of all others.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give brother the flag!&quot; he murmured,
when they finished.</p>

<p class="indent">They handed him the Stars and Stripes, but
he could not retain it, and the princess, quietly
moving to the bedside, steadied it between his
trembling fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now sing with brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two children lifted up their little quavering
voices, and turning his own face to the
ceiling, a face illumined by a joy not of this
world, he tried to sing with them:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;My country! &#39;tis of thee,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Sweet land of liberty,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Of thee I sing!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Here his voice faltered, his radiant face
drooped, and his darkening eyes turned beseechingly
in my direction.</p>

<p class="indent">In a choking voice I finished the verse, as I
had once before finished it for him:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;Land where my fathers died,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Land of the pilgrims&#39; pride,</span><br />
<span class="i2">From every mountainside</span><br />
<span class="i4">Let freedom ring!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
His head was on the pillow when I finished,
but his fingers still grasped the flag.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gerald,&quot; said the princess, tenderly, &quot;do
you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I understand,&quot; fluttered from his pale
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And are you contented?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He pressed her hand slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you rather die, or live to grow up and
forget your country, as you surely would do if
you lived all your young life among strangers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would rather die!&quot; and here his voice was
so firm that all in the room heard it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dottie and Howard!&quot; he murmured, presently,
and the princess drew back. After all,
she was only a stranger.</p>

<p class="indent">He died, with their little faces pressed close
to his own. &quot;Give my love to mamma, dear
mamma!&quot; were his last words. Shortly after
the nurses drew the children away. The boy
had had his wish. He had died for his country
as truly as if he had fallen in battle.</p>

<h2>GRANDMOTHER AND THE CROW</h2>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span></p>

<p class="h2">GRANDMOTHER AND THE CROW.</p>

<p class="indent">When I was a little girl I lived with my
grandmother, and a gay, lively little grandmother
she was. Away back in the family
was French blood, and I am sure that she resembled
French old people, who are usually
vivacious and cheerful. On my twelfth birthday
I was driving with her through a thick
wood, when we heard in front of us the loud
shouting and laughing of boys.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive on, George,&quot; said my grandmother;
&quot;let us see what this is all about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as he stopped, she sprang nimbly
from the phaeton among half-a-dozen flushed
and excited boys who had stones in their hands.
Up in the tall trees above them were dozens of
crows, which were cawing in a loud and distressed
manner, and flying restlessly from branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
to branch. A stone thrown by some boy with
too true an aim had brought a fine young crow
to the ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha&mdash;I&#39;ve got him. Thought I&#39;d bring
him down!&quot; yelled a lad, triumphantly. &quot;Now
give it to him, boys.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The stones flew thick and fast at the poor
crow. My grandmother screamed and waved
her hands, but the boys would not listen to her
until she rushed to the phaeton, seized the
whip, and began smartly slashing those bad
boys about the legs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi&mdash;stop that&mdash;you hurt! Here, some
of you fellows take the whip from her!&quot; cried
the boys, dancing like wild Indians around my
grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cowards!&quot; she said; &quot;if you must fight,
why don&#39;t you attack something your own
size?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boys slunk away, and she picked up the
crow. One of its wings was broken, and its
body was badly bruised. She wrapped the
poor bleeding thing in our lap-robe, and told
George to drive home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another pet, grandmother?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Elizabeth,&quot; she returned, &quot;if it lives.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
She had already eight canaries, some tame
snakes, a pair of doves, an old dog, white mice
and rats, and a tortoise.</p>

<p class="indent">When we got home, she examined the crow&#39;s
injuries, then sponged his body with water, and
decided that his wing was so badly broken that
it would have to be amputated. I held his
head and feet while she performed the surgical
operation, and he squawked most dismally.
When it was over, she offered him bread
and milk, which he did not seem able to
eat until she pushed the food down his throat
with her slim little fingers. Then he opened
and closed his beak repeatedly, like a person
smacking his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He may recover,&quot; she said, with delight;
&quot;now, where is he to sleep? Come into the
garden, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Our garden was walled in. There was a
large kennel on a grass-plot under my grandmother&#39;s
bedroom window, and she stopped in
front of it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This can be fitted up for the crow, Elizabeth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what about Rover?&quot; I said. &quot;Where
will he sleep?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;Down in the cellar, by the furnace,&quot; she
said. &quot;He is getting to be rheumatic, and I
owe him a better shelter than this in his old
age. I shall have a window put in at the back,
so that the sun can shine in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For several days the crow sat in the kennel,
his wings raised,&mdash;the stump of the broken
one was left,&mdash;making him look like a person
shrugging his shoulders, and the blood thickening
and healing over his wounds. Three times
a day my grandmother dragged him out and
pushed some bread and milk down his throat;
and three times a day he kicked and struggled
and clawed at her hands. But it soon became
plain that he was recovering.</p>

<p class="indent">One day my grandmother found him trying
to feed himself, and she was as much pleased
as a child would have been. The next day he
stepped out on the grass-plot. There he found
a fine porcelain bath, that my grandmother
had bought for him. It was full of warm
water, and he stepped into it, flapped his wing
with pleasure, and threw the water over his
body.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is coming on!&quot; cried my grandmother;
&quot;he will be the joy of my life yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;What about Second Cousin George?&quot; I
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Second Cousin George&mdash;we had to call him
that to distinguish him from old George, the
coachman&mdash;was a relative that lived with us.
He was old, cranky, poor, and a little weak-minded,
and if it had not been for my grandmother
he would have been obliged to go to an
almshouse. He hated everything in the world
except himself,&mdash;pets especially,&mdash;and if he
had not been closely watched, I think he would
have put an end to some of the creatures that
my grandmother loved.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 485px;">

<img class="border" src="images/i_045.jpg" width="485" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;I SAW SECOND COUSIN GEORGE FOLLOWING HIM.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">One day after the crow was able to walk
about the garden, I saw Second Cousin George
following him. I could not help laughing, for
they were so much alike. They both were fat
and short, and dressed in black. Both put
their feet down in an awkward manner, carried
their heads on one side, and held themselves
back as they walked. They had about an equal
amount of sense.</p>

<p class="indent">In some respects, though, the crow was a
little ahead of Second Cousin George, and in
some respects he was not, for on this occasion
Second Cousin George was making a kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
death-noose for him, and the crow walked
quietly behind the currant-bushes, never suspecting
it. I ran for grandmother, and she
slipped quickly out into the garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Second Cousin George, what are you doing?&quot;
she said, quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">He always looked up at the sky when he
didn&#39;t know what to say, and as she spoke, he
eyed very earnestly some white clouds that
were floating overhead, and said never a
word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you playing with this cord?&quot; said
grandmother, taking it from him. &quot;What a
fine loop you have in it!&quot; She threw it dexterously
over his head. &quot;Oh, I have caught
you!&quot; she said, with a little laugh, and began
pulling on the string.</p>

<p class="indent">Second Cousin George still stood with his
face turned up to the sky, his cheeks growing
redder and redder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I am choking you!&quot; said grandmother,
before she had really hurt him; &quot;do
let me unfasten it.&quot; Then she took the string
off his neck and put it in her pocket. &quot;Crows
can feel pain just as men do, Second Cousin
George,&quot; she said, and walked away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
Second Cousin George never molested the
crow again.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few weeks the crow became very
tame, and took possession of the garden. He
dug worms from our choicest flower-beds, nipped
off the tops of growing plants, and did them
far more damage than Rover the dog. But my
grandmother would not have him checked in
anything.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor creature!&quot; she said, sympathetically,
&quot;he can never fly again; let him get what
pleasure he can out of life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I was often sorry for him when the pigeons
passed overhead. He would flap his one long,
beautiful wing, and his other poor stump of a
thing, and try to raise himself from the ground,
crying, longingly, &quot;Caw! Caw!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Not being able to fly, he would go quite over
the garden in a series of long hops,&mdash;that is,
after he learned to guide himself. At first
when he spread his wings to help his jumps,
the big wing would swing him around so that
his tail would be where he had expected to find
his head.</p>

<p class="indent">Many a time have I stood laughing at his
awkward attempts to get across the garden to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
grandmother, when she went out with some
bits of raw meat for him. She was his favourite,
the only one that he would allow to come
near him or to stroke his head.</p>

<p class="indent">He cawed with pleasure whenever he saw
her at any of the windows, and she was the
only one that he would answer at all times.
I often vainly called to him, &quot;Hallo, Jim Crow,&mdash;hallo!&quot;
but the instant grandmother said,
&quot;Good Jim Crow&mdash;good Jim!&quot; he screamed
in recognition.</p>

<div class="image-center">

<img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="600" height="254" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">He had many skirmishes with the dog over
bones. Rover was old and partly blind, and
whenever Jim saw him with a bone he went up
softly behind him and nipped his tail. As
Rover always turned and snapped at him, Jim
would seize the bone and run away with it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
Rover would go nosing blindly about the garden
trying to find him. They were very good
friends, however, apart from the bones, and
Rover often did good service in guarding the
crow.</p>

<div class="image-center">
<a name="i_051" id="i_051"></a>
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="565" height="700" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="indent">The cats in the neighbourhood
of course learned
that there was an injured
bird in our garden, and I
have seen as many as six
at a time sitting on the top
of the wall looking down at
him. The instant Jim saw
one he would give a peculiar
cry of alarm that he kept for
the cats alone. Rover
knew this cry, and springing
up would rush toward
the wall, barking angrily,
and frightening the cats
away, though he never
could have seen them
well enough
to catch them.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim detested not cats
alone, but every strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
face, every strange noise, and every strange
creature,&mdash;boys most of all. If one of them
came into the garden he would run to his
kennel in a great fright. Now this dislike of
Jim&#39;s for strange noises saved some of my
grandmother&#39;s property, and also two people
who might otherwise have gone completely to
the bad.</p>

<p class="indent">About midnight, one dark November night,
my grandmother and I were sleeping quietly,&mdash;she
in her big bed, and I in my little one
beside her. The room was a very large one,
and our beds were opposite a French window,
which stood partly open, for my grandmother
liked to have plenty of fresh air at night. Under
this window was Jim&#39;s kennel.</p>

<p class="indent">I was having a very pleasant dream, when
in the midst of it I heard a loud, &quot;Caw! Caw!&quot;
I woke, and found that my grandmother was
turning over sleepily in bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the crow&#39;s cat call,&quot; she murmured;
&quot;but cats could never get into that kennel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me get up and see,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, child,&quot; she replied. Then she reached
out her hand, scratched a match, and lighted the
big lamp that stood on the table by her bed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
I winked my eyes,&mdash;the room was almost as
bright as day, and there, half-way through the
window, was George, our old coachman. His
head was in the room; his feet must have been
resting on the kennel, his expression was confused,
and he did not seem to know whether
to retreat or advance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in, George,&quot; said my grandmother,
gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">He finished crawling through the window,
and stood looking dejectedly down at his stocking
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does this mean, George?&quot; said my
grandmother, ironically. &quot;Are you having
nightmare, and did you think we might wish
to go for a drive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old George never liked to be laughed at.
He drew himself up. &quot;I&#39;m a burglar, missus,&quot;
he said, with dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">My grandmother&#39;s bright, black eyes twinkled
under the lace frills of her nightcap. &quot;Oho,
are you indeed? Then you belong to a dangerous
class,&mdash;one to which actions speak louder
than words,&quot; she said, calmly; and putting one
hand under her pillow, she drew out something
that I had never known she kept there.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
I thought at the time it was a tiny, shining
revolver, but it really was a bit of polished water-pipe
with a faucet attached; for my grandmother
did not approve of the use of firearms.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;&#39;I AIN&#39;T FIT TO DIE,&#39; CRIED OLD GEORGE.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, missus, don&#39;t shoot&mdash;don&#39;t shoot! I
ain&#39;t fit to die,&quot; cried old George, dropping on
his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I quite agree with you,&quot; she said, coolly,
laying down her pretended revolver, &quot;and I am
glad you have some rag of a conscience left.
Now tell me who put you up to this. Some
woman, I&#39;ll warrant you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, missus, it was,&quot; he said, shamefacedly,
&quot;&#39;twas Polly Jones,&mdash;she that you discharged
for impudence. She said that she&#39;d get even
with you, and if I&#39;d take your watch and chain
and diamond ring, and some of your silver, that
we&#39;d go to Boston, and she&#39;d&mdash;she&#39;d&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said grandmother, tranquilly, &quot;she
would do what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She said she&#39;d marry me,&quot; sheepishly whispered
the old man, hanging his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marry you indeed, old simpleton!&quot; said my
grandmother, dryly. &quot;She&#39;d get you to Boston,
fleece you well, and that&#39;s the last you&#39;d see of
her. Where is Miss Polly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
&quot;In&mdash;in the stable,&quot; whimpered the old
man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m,&quot; said grandmother, &quot;waiting for the
plunder, eh? Well, make haste. My purse is
in the upper drawer, my watch you see before
you; here is my diamond ring, and my spoons
you have in your pocket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old George began to cry, and counted every
spoon he had in his pocket out on the bureau
before him, saying one, two, three, four, and so
on, through his tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; said my grandmother. &quot;Put them
back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old man looked at her in astonishment.
She made him return every spoon to his pocket.
Then she ordered him to hang the watch round
his neck, put the ring on his finger, and the
purse in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take them out to the stable,&quot; she said,
sternly; &quot;sit and look at them for the rest of
the night. If you want to keep them by eight
o&#39;clock in the morning, do so,&mdash;if not, bring
them to me. And as for Miss Polly, send her
home the instant you set foot outside there, and
tell her from me that if she doesn&#39;t come to see
me to-morrow afternoon she may expect to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
the town&#39;s officers after her as an accomplice in
a burglary. Now be off, or that crow will alarm
the household. Not by the door, old George,
that&#39;s the way honest people go out. Oh,
George, George, that a carrion crow should
be more faithful to me than you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">My grandmother lay for some time wide-awake,
and I could hear the bed shaking with
her suppressed laughter. Then she would sigh,
and murmur, &quot;Poor, deluded creatures!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Finally she dropped off to sleep, but I lay
awake for the rest of the night, thinking over
what had taken place, and wondering whether
Polly Jones would obey my grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent">I was with her the next day when Polly was
announced. Grandmother had been having
callers, and was sitting in the drawing-room
looking very quaint and pretty in her black
velvet dress and tiny lace cap.</p>

<p class="indent">Polly, a bouncing country-girl, came in hanging
her head. Grandmother sat up very straight
on the sofa and asked, &quot;Would you like to go
to the penitentiary, Polly Jones?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, ma&#39;am!&quot; gasped Polly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you like to come and live with me
for awhile?&quot; said my grandmother.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Now Polly did not want to do this, but she
knew that she must fall in with my grandmother&#39;s
plans; so she hung her head a little
lower and whispered, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then,&quot; my grandmother said, &quot;go
and get your things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day my grandmother called to her
the cook, the housemaid, and the small boy that
ran errands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have all worked faithfully,&quot; she said,
&quot;and I am going to give you a holiday. Here
is some money for you, and do not let me see
you again for a month. Polly Jones is going to
stay with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Polly stayed with us, and worked hard for a
month.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a wicked girl,&quot; said my grandmother
to her, &quot;and you want discipline. You
have been idle, and idleness is the cause of half
the mischief in the world. But I will cure you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Polly took her lesson very meekly, and when
the other maids came home, grandmother took
her on a trip to Boston. There she got a
policeman to take them about and show them
how some of the wicked people of the city
lived. Among other places visited was a prison,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
and when Polly saw young women like herself
behind the bars, she broke down and begged
grandmother to take her home. And that
reformed Polly effectually.</p>

<p class="indent">As for old George, after that one miserable
night in the stable, and his utter contrition in
the morning, he lived only for grandmother, and
died looking lovingly in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">Jim the crow ruled the house as well as the
garden after his exploit in waking grandmother
that eventful night.</p>

<p class="indent">All this happened some years ago. My dear
grandmother is dead now, and I live in her
house. Jim missed her terribly when she died,
but I tried so earnestly to cultivate his affections,
and to make up his loss to him, that I
think he is really getting to be fond of me.</p>

<p class="h3">The Little Colonel. (Trade Mark.)</p>

<p class="indent">The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its
heroine is a small girl, who is known as the Little
Colonel, on account of her fancied resemblance to an

proves to be the grandfather of the child.</p>


<p class="h3">The Giant Scissors.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France,&mdash;the wonderful house with the gate of The
Giant Scissors, Jules, her little playmate, Sister Denisa,
the cruel Brossard, and her dear Aunt Kate. Joyce is

shares with her the delightful experiences of the &quot;House
Party&quot; and the &quot;Holidays.&quot;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel&#39;s Neighbors.</span></p>

not, however, the central figure of the story, that place
being taken by the &quot;two little knights.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ole Mammy&#39;s Torment&quot; has been fitly called &quot;a
classic of Southern life.&quot; It relates the haps and mishaps
of a small negro lad, and tells how he was led by
love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>

<p class="h3">The Story of Dago.</p>

<p class="indent">In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago,
a pet monkey, owned jointly by two brothers. Dago
tells his own story, and the account of his haps and mishaps
is both interesting and amusing.</p>

<p class="h3">The Quilt That Jack Built.</p>

<p class="indent">A pleasant little story of a boy&#39;s labor of love, and
how it changed the course of his life many years after
it was accomplished.</p>

<p class="indent">A story of a boy&#39;s life battle, his early defeat, and his
final triumph, well worth the reading.</p>

a quotation from her introduction, as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One ride is memorable in the early history of the
American Revolution, the well-known ride of Paul
Revere. Equally deserving of commendation is another

historic in its action or memorable in its consequences.&quot;</p>

days, in which the child heroine, Betsey Schuyler,
renders important services to George Washington.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
